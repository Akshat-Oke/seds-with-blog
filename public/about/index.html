        <p>
          SEDS BPHC was founded in April 2019 by a group of students with a
          burning passion for aerospace. Today the club has proudly grown into
          an 80+ member strong team. The club started out by competing in the
          Spaceport America Cup, and has since expanded to cubesats, cansats,
          rocket motors and thrust vector control projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The team is an amalgamation of undergraduate students from almost all
          fields of engineering and science in our college. Mechanical
          Engineering, Computer Science, Biology, Electronics and Communication
          Engineering, Physics are to name a few.
        </p>
        <!-- 
        <p>
          This season, we aim to launch our first rocket on-site at the
          Spaceport America Cup 2022 and participate in the Cansat Competition
          organized by the American Astronautical Society. We are also designing
          two CubeSats which we plan to launch in the near future.Our newly
          established R&D division is testing solid rocket motors and intends to
          work with hybrid motors soon. Thrust Vector Control is also an area of
          research for the team.

        <h2>SA Cup</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          SEDS BPHC made its debut in the prestigious competition of Spaceport
          America Cup in 2021. Among the four BITS Pilani campuses, we were the
          first & only one to participate in the SA Cup.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our category, the goal was to build a rocket 8 feet long, weighing
          approximately 28kg, which flies upto 10,000 feet and uses
          Commercially-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solid rocket motors. Currently the
          team is working on building rckeets to participate in various global
          avenues.

        <h2>CANSAT</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Team Janus represents our campus in the annual international CanSat
          competition. The CanSat competition is designed to reflect a typical
          aerospace program on a small scale. Every year, unique challenges are
          designed to reflect real-world missions, including telemetry
          requirements, communications, and autonomous operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the 2021 mission, the team was required to develop two
          auto-rotating science payloads that descend like a maple-seed, to be
          integrated into the CanSat container. The team reached the CDR stage
          despite the covid pandemic!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the 2022 competition, the payload should be connected to the
          container via a 10m long tether. The mission requires the payload
          camera to maintain an orientation of 45 degrees south consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope to achieve new apogees of success in the esteemed competition.

      <div class="heading"><h2>CUBESAT</h2></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Cubesats are small, highly sophisticated satellites with a wide range
          of applications, including communication, earth observation, and
          defence.
        </p>
        <p>The team is working on two satellites: NEMOlite and NEMO.</p>
        <p>
          The 1U satellite NEMOlite, which will be launched in the coming years,
          will act as a demonstration satellite, demonstrating our capabilities
          to build and deploy satellites. The primary goal is to gain some
          flight time and put the Altitude Determination and Control
          Subsystems(ADCS) to the test. The NEMO satellite is a remote sensing
          satellite that will track the level of microplastic in the Gulf of
          Mannar. NEMO is expected to launch in the distant future.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that the data obtained by our observation satellite will
          assist independent researchers, institutions, and state governments
          better maintain and protect the ecosystem.

          This is the R&D division of SEDS BPHC. Once technologies mature here,
          they would be implemented into our various projects. Currently we’re
          working on:
        </p>
        <p>
          Thrust Vector Control - It is the ability of a rocket to maintain its
          trajectory in motion by manipulating the direction of thrust coming
          out of the exhaust of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocket Motors - We’ve designed, built and tested E, I, G, and K-class
          solid rocket motors. We intend to move towards M-class and hybrid
          rocket motors next.
